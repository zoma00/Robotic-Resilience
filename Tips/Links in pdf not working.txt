links in the index page in pdf format not working ?


now i had discoverd the white space in the header pdf it is hidden link for the back to the main index page so we could remove it from the header.
** in addition the links for the other pages like survival kit and Egypt map are not working in the downloaded pdf?



You’re right—the big white band came from a hidden “Back to …” link at the top. I’ve removed such back links from the composed content before export, tightened PDF spacing, and added working PDF links so you can still navigate from the generated PDF.

What I changed

- Remove back links that add top whitespace
  - In the full-blog export flow in index.html, any top “Back …” or arrow “← …” links are stripped from the cloned content before rendering the PDF. This prevents padding at the header.

- Tighten layout for PDFs
  - In styles.css for `body.pdf-export`, I reduced top margins/paddings so content starts closer to the page top:
    - Smaller section margins/padding, less h1 top margin, lede tightened.

- Add real, working PDF links
  - Two places now add clickable links inside the PDF (these are proper annotations and do work in viewers):
    - At the end, a “Quick Links” page with links to:
      - War Survival Kit
      - Field Navigation Guide
      - Egypt Map Page
      - Survival Blueprint (SVG)
    - At the top of the first page of each section, small inline navigation links:
      - For Home section: Kit, Navigation, Egypt Map
      - For Kit section: Home, Navigation
      - For Navigation section: Home, Kit, Egypt Map

- Keep pages well-filled
  - The exporter trims near-white bands from the top/bottom of each rendered section and slices tall sections by px→pt mapping so each page is filled top-down.

- Offline cache refresh
  - Service worker cache bumped to v6 so these script/style changes take effect offline.

How to verify

- Refresh the homepage twice to load the new assets and activate the updated service worker.
- Use “Download Entire Blog (PDF)”.
- Check:
  - Page 1 should start nearer the top (white band gone).
  - Links at the top of the section pages are clickable.
  - The final “Quick Links” page has working links.

Notes on links inside captured pages
- Links rasterized inside the section images can’t be clickable, which is why I add overlay links at the top and a Quick Links page. These are true PDF annotations and will open in your browser.

If you want, I can also add a small “Links” block to the single-page PDFs (Home, Kit, Navigation) so those downloads include working links too.
