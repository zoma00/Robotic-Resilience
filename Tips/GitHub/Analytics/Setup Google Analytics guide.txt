## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Google Analytics Setup:**

### **🔧 Step 1: Create Property for Your Website**

In your Google Analytics dashboard that's already open:

1. **Click "Create Property"** (or look for "+ Create" button)
2. **Property Name:** `Robotic-Resilience Survival Guide`
3. **Website URL:** `https://zoma00.github.io/Robotic-Resilience/`
4. **Industry Category:** Choose "Education" or "Reference"
5. **Time Zone:** Select your country/timezone

### **📋 Step 2: Get Your Tracking Code**

After creating the property, Google will show you a tracking code that looks like:

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

**🎯 Can you tell me what your tracking ID is?** (It starts with `G-` followed by letters and numbers)

Once you give me the tracking ID, I'll immediately add it to all your HTML files!

### **⚡ What I'll do next:**

1. ✅ Add the tracking code to index.html
2. ✅ Add it to survival-kit.html 
3. ✅ Add it to navigation.html
4. ✅ Add it to egypt.html and pdf-viewer.html
5. ✅ Test that it's working

**Just paste your tracking ID here and I'll handle the rest!** 🚀
