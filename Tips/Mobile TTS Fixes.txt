📱 MOBILE TTS FIXES - SUMMARY

🔧 ISSUES FIXED:
✅ Assamese India (as_IN) voice problem - now filtered out
✅ Arabic numbers being spoken incorrectly - improved voice selection
✅ Language selection not working - added auto-refresh on language change
✅ Mobile device voice loading issues - enhanced mobile support

🎯 IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
